# Image Generation

Use the `generate_image` tool when the user asks you to create, render, draw, design, generate, or edit an image.

If the `generate_image` tool is not available in the current tool list, tell the user that image generation is not enabled for this OriginAgent instance.

## When To Use

- Text-to-image: call `generate_image` with a concrete `prompt`.
- Image editing: pass the saved artifact path or user image path in `reference_images`.
- Iterative edits in the same conversation: prefer the most recent generated image artifact if the user says things like "make it brighter", "change the background", or "try another version".
- Ambiguous edits: ask a short clarifying question if multiple recent images could be the target.
- In the current chat, do not call `message` just to announce or resend generated images. The runtime attaches images from `generate_image` to the final assistant reply automatically.

## Prompt Rules

Write prompts with enough detail for image models:

- Subject and scene.
- Composition and camera or layout.
- Style, mood, lighting, and color palette.
- Text that must appear in the image, quoted exactly.
- Constraints such as "keep the same character", "preserve the logo", or "do not change the background".

## Artifact Rules

The tool stores generated images as persistent artifacts under OriginAgent's media directory and returns structured metadata:

- `id`: generated image id, such as `img_ab12cd34ef56`.
- `path`: local file path for internal follow-up edits.
- `mime`: image MIME type.
- `prompt`, `model`, and `source_images`: provenance for follow-up edits.

In normal user-facing replies, do not expose local filesystem paths. Keep the reply natural, for example "Done, I generated it." You may include the short image `id` when it helps the user refer to a specific image, but keep raw `path` internal unless the user explicitly asks for debug details or a local artifact reference. Never paste base64.

For follow-up edits, pass the prior artifact `path` to `reference_images`. If the user provides a new uploaded image, use that path as the reference instead.

Do not include internal replay markers such as `[Message Time: ...]`, `[image: /local/path]`, `generate_image(...)`, or `message(...)` in user-facing replies.

## Provider Notes

Do not ask users to paste API keys into chat. If configuration is needed, describe the fields; LLM provider and BYOK changes are hot-reloaded for new turns.

For OpenRouter, the image tool expects:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "openrouter": {
      "apiKey": "sk-or-..."
    }
  },
  "tools": {
    "imageGeneration": {
      "enabled": true,
      "provider": "openrouter",
      "model": "openai/gpt-5.4-image-2"
    }
  }
}
```

For AIHubMix, the image tool expects:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "aihubmix": {
      "apiKey": "sk-..."
    }
  },
  "tools": {
    "imageGeneration": {
      "enabled": true,
      "provider": "aihubmix",
      "model": "gpt-image-2-free"
    }
  }
}
```

AIHubMix `gpt-image-2-free` uses AIHubMix's unified predictions endpoint internally (`/v1/models/openai/gpt-image-2-free/predictions`), not the OpenAI Images `/v1/images/generations` endpoint. If it fails with "Incorrect model ID", do not assume the key lacks permission until the provider config, model name, and gateway restart have been checked.

`providers.aihubmix.extraBody` can be used for provider-specific options. For example, `"extraBody": {"quality": "low"}` is optional but can make `gpt-image-2-free` faster and less likely to time out.

## Examples

Generate a new image:

```text
generate_image(
  prompt="A minimal app icon for OriginAgent: friendly robot head, rounded square, soft blue and white palette, clean vector style, no text",
  aspect_ratio="1:1",
  image_size="1K"
)
```

Edit the latest generated artifact:

```text
generate_image(
  prompt="Use the reference image. Keep the same robot and composition, but change the palette to warm orange and add a subtle sunrise background.",
  reference_images=["/home/user/.originagent/media/generated/2026-05-08/img_ab12cd34ef56.png"],
  aspect_ratio="1:1",
  image_size="1K"
)
```
